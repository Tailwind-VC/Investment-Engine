# Investment Protocol at Tailwind VC

### Who we are
Tailwind Ventures Capital is an early-stage venture firm focused on investing companies that can capture the growth tailwind. 

We focus primarily on early stages (from seed to Series B) and across software, deep-tech, and consumer industries.

We want to find start-ups that are founded to solve a very challenging problem with a scalable solution.

### What is our investment process 
We have a systematic rating system focusing on key elements
1. Team (why founders are the best fit team to build this product)
2. Product and Market Fit 
3. Market Trend (why timing is now)
4. Traction (what are evidence for the team ability to execute)
5. Competition 
6. Deal terms (we want asymmetric risk reward payoff)
7. Co-Investors and strategic partnership

We built a research database that has all the key metrics and takeaways from all the deals we have looked in the past. We try to understand the valuation and relative value between the companies.
